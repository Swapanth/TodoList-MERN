## We need to run Client and Server simultaneously.
Follow Below Steps.

## Running the Client

1.Clone the fin-desktop-app repository.
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Swapanth/TodoList-MERN
```

2. Navigate to the project's client directory.

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The client server will be accessible at `http://localhost:7001`.

## Running the Backend Server

1. In a separate terminal window or tab,
2.  Navigate to the project's server directory.
3.  Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the server 
```bash
npm start
```

The frontend will be accessible for tally at `http://localhost:7002`.

## Mongodb atlas Configuration

To ensure proper communication with the backend, you need to configure Mongodb uri with the following settings:

1. Go to `server` > `.env` .
2. Set `MONGODB_URI`.

With these settings configured, the frontend and backend should communicate seamlessly with Ur DB.
